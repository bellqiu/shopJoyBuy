     <h2 class="manual-suit-h2">Suits Style Advice</h2>
      <div class="manual-suit-col-10">
       <p>A man must know his specific body type before he can wear a suit jacket that will fit him properly and create the best image possible. There is a suit style to match and enhance each body type.</p>
       <h3>Suit for Tall Men</h3>
        <p>Tall men are served best in three buttons, single-breasted jackets which minimize their abnormal height.</p>
       <h3>Suit for Short Men</h3>
        <p>Short men will look best in jackets that maximize their height. This is accomplished best in a one or two button jacket that creates a longer "V". Peak lapels are a great option for shorter men and should be standard on a double-breasted jacket. Avoid three buttons, ventless jackets.</p>
        <h3>Suit for Round Men</h3>
        <p>Wear one or two button jackets and keep it buttoned unless sitting. A six button double-breasted jacket will balance a hefty man's weight while creating a longer silhouette from shoulder to the waist.</p>

      <div class="manual-suit-col-13">
        <h3>Shoulders</h3>
        <p>The suit's shoulders should hug yours; shoulder pads should not protrude beyond your own shoulders. If you stand sideways against a wall and the shoulder pad touches the wall before your arm does, the suit is too big.</p>
        </div> 
       <div class="manual-suit-col-13">
       <h3>Chest</h3>
        <p>You should be able to easily button the jacket without it straining. Conversely, there shouldn't be too much space between the button and your chest-no more than a fist's worth.</p>
        </div> 
       <div class="manual-suit-col-13">
       <h3>Length</h3>
        <p>When your arms are hanging straight down, you should be able to cup your fingers under the sides of your suit jacket. However, these days, with shorter suits in style, some jackets reach only about an inch beyond the cuff of your suit sleeve.</p>
      </div> 
       <div class="manual-suit-col-13">
        <h3>Three Buttons</h3>
        <p>The three-button suit became the dominant look in the 1990s; it now seems to be the standard young man's choice. Instead of opting for one of those high-cut versions, look for one with a roll-over lapel-one in which you button the middle button, encouraging the soft lapel to roll over the top button.</p>
        </div> 
       <div class="manual-suit-col-13">
       <h3>Two Buttons</h3>
        <p>For years the two-button suit was the go-to conservative, Capitol Hill getup. Now every fashion label imaginable is designing two-button suits, except they're making them more streamlined and modern. This cut is what's most in style right now.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="manual-suit-col-13">
       <h3>One Button</h3>
        <p>If you're looking for something rakish, a bit more high-style, try a one-button suit. It's not for everyone, but if you can pull it off, it's a sleek look.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="manual-suit-col-10">
       <h3>Vents</h3>
        <p>A center vent is all-purpose, it is both modern and traditional, You can't go wrong.</br>Side vents are more European, a bit more suave.</br>A ventless jacket is just plain wrong. It says you think it's still 1986.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="manual-suit-col-10">
       <h3>Lapel</h3>
        <p>A notch lapel-what you see on most business suits-is the standard. You're always safe with a notch lapel.<br>A peak lapel is more old-school and elegant. And now it's enjoying a comeback with the high-fashion crowd. It makes a statement.</p>
