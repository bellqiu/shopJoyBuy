                <h3>It's all done by us</h3>
                <p>Our custom suits are of the highest quality, created by the same school of highly skilled tailors, using the same superior fabrics and techniques, employed by well known high-end fashion houses. Yet we can offer you a garment to rival these designer brands at a fraction of their price. "That's awesome!" you say. but how do we do that?</p> 
            
            <p>Well, we simply cut out the middlemen. By "middlemen" we mean the layers of companies and individuals employed by fashion houses to purchase fabrics, manage suppliers and sell their products in overtly opulent retail stores. All of these people and their bills need to be paid and these extra costs are passed on to you, the customer.</p>
            
            <p>We disrupt the traditional, outdated business model to create a brand that is centered around you. We create our own designs and produce the garments ourselves. In addition, we deliver our products from our high-tech manufacturing facility in Shanghai direct to your door. This results in a simpler, more efficient process, which in turn allows us to pay our manufacturers more fairly and ensure that our customers pay a price that cannot be beaten.</p>
