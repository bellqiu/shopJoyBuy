        <p>In order to make the best garments possible for you, HoneyBuy uses 16 body measurements to create a completely custom suit that's meant to fit you perfectly. 
        We guide you through our online measurement process step-by-step with easy to follow instructions. It only takes 10 minutes and can be done from the comfort of your own home. You don't need a tailor, only a good friend.</p>
        <p>You'll be prompted to get measured once you're ready to checkout - after choosing from a full selection of suits, shirts and outerwear and customizing the details to match your style.
        </p>
        <p>Once your order is placed, one of our Master Tailors will take your body measurements and create a custom pattern just for you. 
        This is a one time process, but you can always refine your garment measurements later on. <br>To refine your measurement, please login to <a href="/uc/my-measurements">My Profile</a> then click <strong>My Measurements</strong> to edit.</p>

                <li>You had assistance from a friend when measuring (although the majority of the measurements can easily be self-taken, we have found the process to be faster if you have someone readily available to assist you. In addition, if you would rather use a local tailor or seamstress,

         <h3>About Measuring:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>When taking measurements the tape should be held flat against the body, it should be held snug enough so not droop, but never so tight as to feel restrictive.
                <li>All measurements should be taken to the nearest quarter (.25) inch.</li>
                <li>Do not add wiggle room to your measurements. We will adjust the fit based off of your selected preferences and build.</li>
              </ul>
