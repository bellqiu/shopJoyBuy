<div class="detail">
<span><p>Our customers in Brazil have informed us that for international shipments, all individuals are supposed to state their ��CPF�� number on invoices and companies are required to include a ��CNPJ�� number.</p>
Therefore, if you want us to ship your order to Brazil, please make sure to provide the correct "CPF" or "CNPJ" number so your package can smoothly clear Customs.
