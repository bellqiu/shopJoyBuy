<span>The majority of our products can be cancelled up until they are shipped for the refund. 
If your order status is On Shopping or Pending, you can just ignore the order. We only process the order which is paid. 
</br>If your order status is Paid, you can submit one email or call to cancel your order and we can only refund your part refund. 
The rest will be as a compensation for our company, because we spend lots of energy and labor to deal with your order. 
Once an order has been shipped, it can no longer be cancelled. 
<p>See the chart below for information on products that may require a restocking/processing fee:</p></span>
