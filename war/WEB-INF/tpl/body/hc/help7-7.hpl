<p>It's no problem to change. Even if you first chose Western Union, you can still pay via PayPal.</p>

<p>You can send money directly to our PayPal account: <a href="mailto:paypal@joybuy.co.uk">paypal@joybuy.co.uk </a></p>

<p>Please let us know your order number in the comments (when you pay via PayPal you can add comments).</p>

<p>As soon as we confirm that payment has been received, we will start to process your order.</p>
