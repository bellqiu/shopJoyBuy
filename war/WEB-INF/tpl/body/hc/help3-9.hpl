<h2>Alterations</h2>
<span><p>If your size fluctuates or you want to modify the dress slightly, we always leave a few inches in the seams so that your local tailor can easily make alterations as needed. Dresses generally have a margin of 1 inch on either side of a seam. Flower detailing, beading or belts/ribbons may limit the ability to let a dress out.</p>
<p>Should your item size differ from the specifications of your order by more than one inch, we encourage you to find a local tailor to make adjustments, and we will gladly reimburse you part of money as the tailoring costs. If you choose this option, please remember to request a receipt from your tailor as a copy of it must be provided when requesting reimbursement.</p>
<p>Dresses or clothing that does not fit properly but fits the specifications you ordered cannot be returned or exchanged. As our dresses and clothing is made with additional fabric in the seams, you can make minor adjustments at a local tailor, at your own cost.</p>
</span>
