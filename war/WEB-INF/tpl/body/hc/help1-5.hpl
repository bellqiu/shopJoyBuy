<span>All of our items require processing time on top of the shipping time. Processing time can be as short as 24 hours, but for most items are between 8-12 business days (See <a href="#">how do I estimate my delivery date?</a>). Shipping time varies based on the shipping methods you chose at checkout, see the chart below for our different shipping options:</span>

  <p>For example, if you order a wedding dress, it will need 10-14 business days of processing time and then 1-3 business days of shipping time if you select expedited shipping. Therefore, you can expect to receive it in 10-16 business days.    </p>
  <p>You can go to My Orders and click on the order you need help with to check the current status of your order and view the estimated shipping date.</p>
<p>Once your items have shipped, we"ll send you an email confirming shipment and include all relevant tracking information we can provide. </p></div>
